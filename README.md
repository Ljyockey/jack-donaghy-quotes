## API
The API has a single endpoint, `/quotes`, which returns a single quote inside of an array. 
Ability to get more than one quote at once is coming soon! 
Available quotes can be viewed in the [quotes.js file](./quotes.js)

## Running Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ljyockey/jack-donaghy-quotes.git
cd jack-donaghy-quotes
npm i
npm start
```

Quotes will be available at http://localhost:8080/quotes
